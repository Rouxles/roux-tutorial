# Roux Tutorial

This will simply be a written guide on a roux tutorial as there are not many good resources out there on it.

The website will be split up into three different parts - the first aimed for absolute beginners/those not as comfortable with the cube, the second aimed for those trying out roux (switching from CFOP), and the third containing resources to improve, and a general idea of when to learn them.

Hopefully this will be finished in the near future - preferably before 2021.
